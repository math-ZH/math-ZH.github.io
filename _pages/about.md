I am a first-year doctoral student in computational mathematics at [LSEC](https://www.cc.ac.cn/), [AMSS](https://www.amss.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS). I graduated from the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.nwpu.edu.cn/) at Northwestern Polytechnical University(NPU).

My research interests include finite element methods for interface problems and its preconditioning.
